The attacks are large scale network attacks including DNS worms, http worms, and DDoS attacks. The worms and DDoS attacks have been parameterized to exhibit various propagation characteristics.\"\n\nThe dataset simulates virtually the entire IPv4 space.

About 14,000 appear to be real hosts (they complete at least one three-way handshake).

Most of the UDP traffic is DNS. While most of the TCP traffic is HTTP, SMTP, and SSH.\n\nResearchers at Colorado State University are analyzing the trace to characterize existing attacks.
