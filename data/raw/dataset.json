The data is comprised of logs submitted by over 1700 networks and including 5 full Class B networks, over 45 full Class C networks and many smaller subnetworks.  This data set includes DSHIELD logs collected daily between 2005 and 2007 and 2008 - 2010.  The logs provide a condensed summary obtained from various firewall and DS platforms included BlackIce Defender, CISCO PIX Firewalls, ZoneAlarm, Linux IPchains, Portsentry and Snort.",

        "long_desc": "The 2009 DARPA dataset is a synthesized dataset created to simulate real Internet traffic and network attacks. Its duration is 10 days, between November 3 - 12, 2009. The dataset is about 6 TB, divided into thousands of pcap files of 954M each. The content was described as follows: \"The traffic contains synthetic HTTP, SMTP, and DNS background data. The attacks are large scale network attacks including DNS worms, http worms, and DDoS attacks. The worms and DDoS attacks have been parameterized to exhibit various propagation characteristics.\"\r\n\r\nThe dataset simulates virtually the entire IPv4 space. There are at least 212 class A networks, 2934 class B networks, and 3302 class C subnets with active IP hosts. Within these subnets there are about 17,000 distinct visible source IP addresses. About 14,000 appear to be real hosts (they complete at least one three-way handshake). Network traffic rates reach speeds of 10MB/sec.\r\n\r\nServices found in the trace include, Domain Name System (DNS), NetBIOS Name Service, Network Time Protocol (NTP), NetBIOS Datagram Service, cmip-agent, DHCPv6 server, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), Secure Shell (SSH), FTP control, identAuthentication Service/Identification Protocol, Microsoft-DS SMB file sharing,NetBIOS NetBIOS Session Service, Hypertext Transfer Protocol over SSL/TLS (HTTPS), Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). Most of the UDP traffic is DNS. While most of the TCP traffic is HTTP, SMTP, and SSH.\r\n\r\nResearchers at Colorado State University are analyzing the trace to characterize existing attacks. Preliminary analysis has shown the existence of several SYN attacks. For more information please contact Christos Papadopoulos christos@cs.colostate.edu.",
